## It Learnt from [here](https://github.com/CompleteBlenderCreator/09.Destruction-and-Deformation)


### Section 9 Introduction ###



### Welcome to Destruction ###



### Quick Explode ###

+ This may be all you need if you want something quick.
+ It can be used as a starting point.
+ We’ll explore what it is actually doing for us.

### Introduction To Blender Physics ###

+ Simulate the real world.
+ You can manually place every bit of destroyed or deformed geometry if you wanted to.
+ Enables you to create a complex scene easily and quickly.
+ Great for realism, shattering glass, falling towers.
+ We will start with something simple.

**Rigid Body Physics**

+ Simulates the physics of solid bodies.
+ Works closely with the Animation system.
+ It will move and rotate objects
+ It will not deform them.

### Copying Physics Properties ###

+ Physics properties are not linked to the object or data datablock.
+ They are part of the Scene Datablock.
+ You cannot make links to the physics.
+ You can however, copy from an active mesh object.

### Centre Of Mass ###

+ Wherever the ORIGIN is.
+ You have control of this which isn’t always a good thing.
+ This can lead to some strange results.
+ Blender can calculate the centre of mass (assuming a uniform density)

### Animating With Physics ###

+ Remember: Blender allows you to animate almost anything.
+ We can use this to toggle whether we are in control of, or the physics engine is in charge of our mesh.
+ Blenders Physics Engine will remember what has just happened in the animation.
+ Quick peek at the graph editor

### Breaking Up A Model Using Particles ###

+ Unfortunately Blender needs to be told HOW to break something up.
+ There are a couple of ways of doing that:
+ Manually- The most time consuming, not advised.
+ Otherwise:- Generally using a particle system.
+ Physics can then be applied to the pieces OR the particle system
+ The way that particles are affected by physics is controlled in the particle system tab.
+ The Mesh itself doesn’t have to have physics.
+ Other objects that interact with the particles no need physics.
+ Look at Particle settings.
+ Look at the collision physics Data.

### Force Fields And Particles ###
